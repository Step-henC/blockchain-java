# Blockchain with Java as a DoublyLinkedList

Create a simple blockchain with java. Adopted from [here](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa). 

However, I made the blockchain as a manually implemented as a DoublyLinkedList as opposed to the ArrayList in the tutorial.

Blockchains involve hashes of the previous node, immediately signaling me to implement DoublyLinkedList


Test drived Design.
